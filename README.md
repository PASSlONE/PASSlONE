<details>
  <summary>about me / other</summary>
  i prefer to be called emi, or mango by close friends.<br/>
  my special interests are vocaloid and ihnmaims.<br/>
  i have many hyperfixations, but my main ones rn are South Park, Homestuck, and JJBA.<br/>
  i am from Hungary, but I prefer to speak English!<br/>
  yeah um i don't really like sp ships. its ok.<br/>
  i get pissed off/jealous easily, please forgive me! i cant control it...<br/>
  i hide/block VERY freely, feel free to ask why I did it tho. I usually have a reason.<br/>
  about my f/o's: i take my relationships with them VERY seriously. i genuinely have panic attacks when I see doubles. It do be like that.<br/>
  I am a heavy Tavrisoleriterezepetamzeequiradikarnayaferi, Osaka, KAngel, and Sayori kin, sadly. I'd prefer doubles not to int.<br/>
  my mental illnesses influence how I act and speak, so I will be off-putting. sorry.<br/>
  please, do tell me if I did smth wrong.<br/>
