## before you int ! ❤︎

I have a lot of mental illnesses, includin *audhd, and schizophrenia.*<br/>
I get angry/jealous easily, please bear with me.<br/>
I may misspell stuff on purpose.<br/>
I may get clingy. i cant control it, and if it makes you uncomfortable, then i'll gladly try tonin it dowwn for you!<br/>
Everything that i say is platonic, unless I say otherwwise.<br/>
my internet is abysmal so i may disconnect.<br/>
I hide/block freely. feel free to ask wwhy I did it, though! i usually havve a reason.<br/>
I'm extremely nonsharin, and if you yume/selfship with the same characters as me, I'll block or avvoid you. **friends are exceptions.**<br/>
